       " 'Spock',\n",
       " 'Spock is a fictional character in the Star Trek media franchise. He first appeared in the original Star Trek series serving aboard the starship USS Enterprise as science officer and first officer (and Kirk\\'s Second-in-command) and later as commanding officer of two iterations of the vessel. Spock\\'s mixed human-Vulcan heritage serves as an important plot element in many of the character\\'s appearances. Along with Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), he is one of the three central characters in the original Star Trek series and its films. After retiring from active duty in Starfleet, Spock served as a Federation ambassador, and later became involved in the ill-fated attempt to save Romulus from a supernova, leading him to live out the rest of his life in a parallel universe.\\nSpock was played by Leonard Nimoy in the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, eight of the Star Trek feature films, and a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Multiple actors have played the character since Nimoy within Star Trek\\'s main continuity; the most recent portrayal is Ethan Peck, who played Spock as a recurring character in the second season of Star Trek: Discovery and in Star Trek: Short Treks. Peck has reprised the role, this time as a main character, in the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, which acts as both a Discovery spin-off and a prequel to the original Star Trek series. Additionally, Zachary Quinto played an alternate reality version of Spock in the feature films Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and Star Trek Beyond (2016). Although the three films are set in the aforementioned parallel timeline, Nimoy appears in the first two as the original timeline\\'s Spock.\\nAside from the series and films in the Star Trek franchise, Spock has also appeared in numerous novels, comics, and video games. Nimoy\\'s portrayal of Spock made a significant cultural impact and earned him three Emmy Award nominations. His public profile as Spock was so strong that both his autobiographies, I Am Not Spock (1975) and I Am Spock (1995), were written from the viewpoint of coexistence with the character.\\nSpock\\'s backstory has been explained during the course of several episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series, the 2009 film Star Trek and the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \"Yesteryear\" . Spock was born to the Vulcan Sarek (Mark Lenard) and the human Amanda Grayson (Jane Wyatt). \\nSpock had a troubled childhood due to his mixed heritage. Full-blooded Vulcan children repeatedly bullied Spock on their home world to incite the emotions of his human nature. For a time, he grew up alongside his older half-brother Sybok, until the older brother was cast out for rejecting logic. In Star Trek: Discovery, it is revealed that Spock has a human, adopted sister, Michael Burnham. According to the episode \"Amok Time\", Spock was betrothed to T\\'Pring (Arlene Martel) during his childhood.\\nSarek supported Spock\\'s scientific learning and application to the Vulcan Science Academy, as mentioned in \"Journey to Babel\". In the 2009 film Star Trek, Spock rejects his acceptance into the Vulcan Science Academy on the basis that they would never fully accept someone who was only half-Vulcan. Although this film set the Kelvin timeline scene in this and later films, writer Roberto Orci stated that he felt that the actions were unaffected by the changes in this timeline and so would have occurred in the same manner prior to The Original Series. Because Spock did not enter the VSA and sought to join Starfleet instead, he did not speak to his father for the following 18 years.\\nSpock appeared as the science officer on the USS Enterprise in the first pilot for the series, \"The Cage\". This was not shown on television at the time, but the events of the episode were shown in the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\" of the first season, and Spock\\'s previous 11 years of service on the Enterprise were described. Spock was one of the members of the away team who joined Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) on a mission to Talos IV in order to investigate a distress call. Spock did appear in the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", but this was broadcast initially as the third episode. During the events of that pilot, Spock became concerned at the risk to the ship posed by Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and suggested possible solutions to Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner).\\nThe earliest appearance of Spock in the series as broadcast was \"The Man Trap\", the first such episode. When he needs to knock out an evil version of Kirk in \"The Enemy Within\", he uses a Vulcan nerve pinch. Spock and Chief Engineer Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott (James Doohan) work together to rejoin the good and evil versions of the Captain, which had been split following a transporter accident. During \"Miri\", he finds himself to be the only member of the landing party to be immune to the physical effects of the disease affecting human adults on the planet. However, he realises that he is probably a carrier and could infect the Enterprise if he were to return. Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) manages to devise a cure, allowing the team to return to the ship.\\nWhen Simon van Gelder enters the bridge armed with a phaser in \"Dagger of the Mind\", Spock subdues him with a nerve pinch. He later conducts a mind meld with van Gelder as part of the investigation into the activities of the nearby colony. After the power to the colony is shut down, and a protective force field drops, Spock leads an away team to rescue Kirk. Spock is reunited with Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) in \"The Menagerie\". Pike had been promoted to Fleet Captain but suffered an accident, resulting in severe burns and confining him to a wheelchair and restricting his communication to yes/no answers via a device connected to his brainwaves. Spock commits mutiny and directs the ship to travel to Talos IV, a banned planet. He recounts the events of \"The Cage\" under a tribunal to Kirk, Pike and Commodore Jose I. Mendez (Malachi Throne). As the Enterprise arrives at the planet, Mendez is revealed to be a Talosian illusion. At the same time, the real Mendez communicates from Starfleet, giving permission for Pike to be transported to the planet, and all charges against Spock are dropped.\\nWhile the Enterprise is under threat in \"Balance of Terror\", Spock is accused by Lieutenant Stiles (Paul Comi) of knowing more about the Romulans than he admits when the alien\\'s similar physical appearance is revealed. Spock hypothesises that they are an offshoot of the Vulcan race. He saves the Enterprise, manning the phaser station and saves the life of Stiles in the process. Spock leads a landing party on the shuttlecraft Galileo in \"The Galileo Seven\", which is damaged and pulled off course and lands on the planet Taurus II. Lieutenant Boma (Don Marshall) criticises Spock\\'s fascination with the weaponry of the natives after the death of Lieutenant Latimer (Rees Vaughn) at their hands. After Scotty uses the power packs of the party\\'s phasers to supply enough energy to get the damaged shuttle back into orbit, Spock decides to dump and ignite the remaining fuel to attract the attention of the Enterprise. The procedure is successful and the crew on the shuttle are rescued.\\nSpock is reunited with Leila Kalomi (Jill Ireland) in \"This Side of Paradise\"; after joining an away team to the planet Omicron Ceti III. After being affected by planet spores, Spock begins showing emotion and re-initiates his romantic liaison with Kalomi. The impact of the spores on him is cured after Kirk goads him into anger, and once freed of the effects, Spock is able to initiate a solution which cures the rest of the crew. Spock attempts to mind meld with a non-humanoid Horta in \"The Devil in the Dark\", having initially suggested that Kirk should kill the creature. Following a second mind meld, Spock relays the history of the Horta and is able to create peace between the aliens and a nearby colony. Both Spock and Kirk undertake guerrilla warfare against the occupying Klingon forces on the planet Organia, prior to the establishment of the Organian Peace Treaty in \"Errand of Mercy\". To restore the timeline, he travels with Kirk back to 1930\\'s New York City in \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". He uses technology of that period to interface with his tricorder over the course of the weeks they spend in the period before witnessing Edith Keeler\\'s (Joan Collins) death.\\n\\nIn the premiere episode of the second season, \"Amok Time\", Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must undergo a ritual mating in the next eight days or die. Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the Enterprise to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T\\'Pring (Arlene Martel). She rather wishes to be with Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne), a full-blooded Vulcan. She demands the ritual kal-if-fee fight instead, and selects Kirk as her champion, who unknowingly agrees to a fight to the death with Spock. McCoy persuades T\\'Pau (Celia Lovsky) to let him inject Kirk with something to alleviate the issues with Vulcan\\'s thinner atmosphere and make the fight fair. The fight begins, and Spock gains the upper hand, garroting Kirk and killing him. McCoy orders an emergency transport directly to sickbay, while Spock is told by T\\'Pring that it was all a game of logic which would let her be with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the Enterprise where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.During the course of the encounter with the Nomad space probe in \"The Changeling\", Spock undertakes a mind meld with the machine. Kirk stops the meld when he realises that Spock\\'s personality starts to be changed by the contact. Following a transporter accident which transports Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Scotty to a Mirror Universe and swaps them with their counterparts in the episode \"Mirror, Mirror\", they encounter a different version of Spock. Sporting a beard, he grows suspicious of the activities of the suddenly changed personnel and under Starfleet orders, attempts to kill Kirk. Mirror-Spock is knocked unconscious, and is treated by McCoy while the others head to the transporter to attempt to return to their universe. Spock awakes and mind melds with McCoy to discover why Kirk did not have him killed. Discovering what took place, he agrees to help them return and as he mans the transporter controls, Kirk implores him to take control and save not only the ship but his Terran Empire from implosion at the hands of tyrants. The switch is once again successful, and the crew members return to their relevant universes.\\nAt the beginning of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Spock is no longer in Starfleet, having resigned and returned home to pursue the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr. Spock is unable to complete the Kolinahr ritual after he senses the coming of V\\'ger, and rejoins Starfleet to aid the Enterprise crew in their mission. Spock, promoted to captain, is commanding officer of the Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). At the film\\'s end, he transfers his \"katra\"\\xa0– the sum of his memories and experience\\xa0– to McCoy, and then sacrifices himself to save the ship and its crew from Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbán). The sequel, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), focuses on his crewmates\\' quest to recover Spock\\'s body, learning upon arrival that he has been resurrected by the Genesis matrix after landing on the planet at the end of the previous film. At the film\\'s conclusion, Spock\\'s revived body is reunited with his katra. Spock is next seen in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), which depicts his recovery from the after-effects of his resurrection. In the film\\'s final scene, he joins the crew of the newly commissioned USS Enterprise-A under Kirk\\'s command. In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989), Spock and the Enterprise crew confront the renegade Sybok, Spock\\'s half-brother. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) reunites the Enterprise crew on a mission to prevent war from erupting between the Federation and Klingon Empire. Spock serves as a special envoy to broker peace with the Klingons after a natural disaster devastates their homeworld.\\nAfter a period in which the production team avoided mentioning some aspects of The Original Series, Spock was mentioned by name in Star Trek: The Next Generation in the episode \"Sarek\" (1990). Executive producer Michael Piller later described this one act as \"the breakthrough which allowed us to open the doors, that allowed us to begin to embrace our past\".\\nSpock appears in \"Unification\" (1991), a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Set 75 years after the events of The Undiscovered Country, the episode focuses on Federation Ambassador Spock\\'s attempt to reunite the Romulans with their Vulcan brethren. Filming of The Undiscovered Country overlapped with production of this episode, and the episode references Spock\\'s role in the film. While Spock\\'s initial unification campaign fails, he chooses to remain on Romulus in secret to help the movement.\\nSpock\\'s next appearance in the live action Star Trek franchise is the 2009 Star Trek film. Nimoy was given approval rights over Spock\\'s casting and supported Quinto being cast as the role.\\nIn the film\\'s flashback (set 19 years after the events of \"Unification\", and as depicted in the comic miniseries Star Trek: Countdown), Ambassador Spock (Nimoy) promises the Romulans he will use Vulcan technology to save them from a rogue supernova that threatens to destroy their Empire. He pilots an advanced starship equipped with red matter, a powerful substance able to create artificial black holes. The mission is only partially successful, and in the aftermath Spock is pursued into the past by Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan driven mad by the loss of his homeworld and family, setting into motion the events of the film.\\nIn the film\\'s opening act, Nero\\'s ship emerges in the year 2233, and through its interaction with the inhabitants, inadvertently creates an \"alternate, parallel \\'Star Trek\\' universe\". Twenty-five years later in the new reality, Spock\\'s ship emerges, and Nero captures him and the red matter. Stranded in the alternate past, the prime version of Spock helps the alternate, younger version of himself and Kirk (Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, respectively) thwart Nero\\'s attempt to destroy the Federation.\\nThe film also features Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock\\'s childhood, including his abuse at the hands of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock\\'s initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls \"... a friendship that will define them both in ways they cannot yet realize.\" A major change in characterization from the primary timeline is alternate Spock\\'s involvement with alternate Uhura (Zoe Saldana), his former student. At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while his older self stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock\\'s home planet.\\nIn Star Trek Into Darkness, Spock Prime is described as living on \\'New Vulcan\\' while the younger Spock remains aboard the Enterprise struggling with the loss of his homeworld, as well as his relationships with Uhura and James T. Kirk. Spock nearly dies protecting a planet from an active volcano, but Kirk breaks the Prime Directive and saves him.  Spock Prime is contacted by Spock on the Enterprise, to find out details on Khan. Spock Prime initially reminds his alternate self that he will not interfere with the events in the alternate timeline. That being said, he then informs Spock that Khan was a dangerous man, and the greatest threat that the Enterprise ever faced in his own timeline, and warns that he is likely as dangerous in Spock\\'s alternate timeline as well. When asked whether Khan was defeated, Spock Prime answers that he eventually was defeated, but at great cost (referring to the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). When Kirk contracts radiation poisoning and dies in front of Spock (a transposed parallel of events in the prime timeline where Spock dies in front of Kirk), an enraged and vengeful Spock attempts to kill Khan to avenge Kirk before Uhura informs him that Khan\\'s regenerative blood can revive Kirk. Nearly a year later, Spock remains as Kirk\\'s chief science officer and executive officer as the Enterprise departs on its first five-year mission of deep-space exploration.\\nInto Darkness would be Nimoy\\'s final appearance as Spock Prime, as well as the last role of his career. He died in 2015, shortly before production began on Star Trek Beyond.\\nIn Star Trek Beyond, Spock receives word that Ambassador Spock (Spock Prime) has died. Impacted by this, Spock later tells McCoy that he intends to leave Starfleet to continue the ambassador\\'s work on New Vulcan. At the end of the film, Spock receives a box containing some of Ambassador Spock\\'s personal effects, and reflecting on a photograph of the older crew of the Enterprise from the series\\' original timeline, he chooses to remain in Starfleet.\\nIn August 2018 it was announced that Ethan Peck would join the cast of Star Trek: Discovery as Spock in the show\\'s second season, portraying a Spock younger than both Nimoy\\'s and Quinto\\'s renditions of the character, as Discovery is set several years before the Original Series and Kelvin Timeline films.\\nAs of his appearances on Discovery, Spock is a Lieutenant, serving under Captain Christopher Pike on the Enterprise. Due to the trauma Spock suffered because of his visions of the \"Red Angel\", he is on leave from the Enterprise and under psychiatric care. His adopted sister Michael Burnham is attempting to help him recover.\\nThe introduction to the second season episode \"If Memory Serves\" uses archival footage of Nimoy as Spock from the unaired pilot episode \"The Cage\", and the third season episode \"Unification III\" uses archival footage of Nimoy again from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Unification II\". The latter appearance is a holographic recording from the records of Jean-Luc Picard, and is shown to Michael Burnham after she travels to the 31st Century, a time in which the Romulan and Vulcan peoples remember Ambassador Spock as the cause of their reunification on the planet Ni\\'Var, the newly renamed Vulcan.\\nIn 2019, it was announced that the character Spock, as played by Peck would appear in two Star Trek: Short Treks, along with Captain Pike. He reprised the role in the episodes \"Q&A\" and \"Ask Not\".\\nIn May 2020, it was announced that Spock (Ethan Peck) would return in the series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds alongside Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and Number One / Una (Rebecca Romjin).\\nThe earliest known mention of Spock was in a conversation between Star Trek\\'s creator Gene Roddenberry and actor Gary Lockwood, in which Lockwood suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. The trio had previously worked together on Roddenberry\\'s The Lieutenant in the episode \"In the Highest Tradition\". Roddenberry agreed to the idea, but was required to audition other actors for the part. At the time, Roddenberry sought DeForest Kelley to play the doctor character in the pilot, \"The Cage\", but both NBC executives and director Robert Butler wanted Kelley to play Spock. Roddenberry offered the part to both Kelley and Martin Landau, but they both turned him down. When offered, Nimoy accepted the part but was apprehensive about the make-up which had not been determined at that point.\\nDuring an interview segment of TV Land\\'s 40th Anniversary Star Trek Marathon on November 12, 2006 Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry\\'s first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey\\'s close friend Ernest Borgnine writes in his autobiography, \"my hand to God – he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV\\'s Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\"\\nThe character evolved from having a metal plate in his stomach through which he ingested energy to being a half-Martian in the original 1964 pitch with a \"slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears\". Due to Roddenberry\\'s concern that a Mars landing might take place before the end of the series, Spock\\'s home planet was changed. Lee Greenway conducted the initial makeup tests on Nimoy, but after four or five days, Fred Phillips was asked to take over. Phillips in turn asked John Chambers to create Spock\\'s ears, as he was working on getting an appropriate shade of red for Spock\\'s skin; this idea was later abandoned in favor of a yellow hue because of the effects on black and white television. Nimoy hated the ears, and Roddenberry promised him that if he was still unhappy by the 13th episode then they\\'d find a way to write them out. The NBC executives were also concerned, as they felt it made the character satanic.\\nAt Roddenberry\\'s insistence, Spock was the only character retained for the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". However, NBC demanded that he be only a background character, and when it went to series, the tips of Spock\\'s ears were airbrushed out on promotional materials. It was during early episodes such as \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" and \"The Naked Time\" that Nimoy came to understand the nature of the character. After eight episodes, NBC executives complained to Roddenberry that there was not enough Spock in the series; \"Spockmania\" had begun. In response, Spock was moved to a more prominent role within the series, such as taking the lead role in \"This Side of Paradise\" over Sulu. The popularity of the character caused frictions with Shatner, and rumours spread that he was going to be dropped from the show and replaced as the lead by Nimoy as Spock. A drawn out contract renegotiation at the start of season two resulted in Roddenberry considering whether or not to replace Nimoy and the character. Both Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne were seriously considered.\\nThe character continued to develop, with Nimoy creating the Vulcan salute during the filming of \"Amok Time\". This was based on a Jewish Kohen he had seen as a child. During the course of the season, a rift grew between Nimoy and Roddenberry and by the end of the year, they only spoke through formal letters. After the departure of producer Gene L. Coon and the stepping back of Roddenberry during the third season, Nimoy found that the writing of Spock deteriorated. In particular, he did not like the character being made a fool of during the episode \"Spock\\'s Brain\". The interracial kiss between Kirk and Uhura in \"Plato\\'s Stepchildren\" had been intended by the writers to be between Spock and Uhura, but Shatner persuaded them to change it. For his role as Spock, Leonard Nimoy was nominated three times Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and is currently the only Star Trek actor to be nominated for an Emmy.\\nNimoy agreed to return to Spock during one of the early 1970s attempts to create a Star Trek film, entitled Star Trek: The God Thing, but dropped out after his likeness as Spock was used without permission to advertise Heineken beer. He was persuaded to return to the role of Spock as the lead for the planned Trek film titled Planet of the Titans to be directed by Philip Kaufman. When this project was killed in favor of a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II, Nimoy was reportedly just offered only a recurring part by Roddenberry, so refused to appear at all. When the decision was made to turn the TV pilot script into Star Trek: The Motion Picture, director Robert Wise insisted Nimoy to return as the character, which was only accomplished by Jeffrey Katzenberg forcing Paramount to settle the dispute with Nimoy over licensing use of his image. As on the series, Nimoy, calling on method acting training, would often not break character between takes.\\nDissatisfied with the first Trek feature, Nimoy was reluctant to return for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan but was convinced by the promise of a dramatic death scene. Nimoy enjoyed the production of the film so much that despite his character\\'s on-screen death he wanted to return for a sequel. The film\\'s success allowed Nimoy to successfully negotiate to direct the next installment in addition to briefly appearing as a reanimated Spock. The resulting film, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock was successful enough that Nimoy was asked to direct once more for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The following film of the series, the William Shatner-directed Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was initially unacceptable to Nimoy because it called for Spock to betray Kirk and side with his newly introduced half-brother Sybok. Nimoy felt his character had already come to terms with his human-side thus Sybok would have no influence on him, and forced the script to be changed before signing on. Nimoy subsequently organized Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, choosing the director, writers and producers. To hand over to Star Trek: The Next Generation at the time of The Undiscovered Country, Nimoy agreed to appear as Spock in the episode \"Unification\". Nimoy subsequently turned down the directing role on Star Trek Generations as he wanted to rework the script, and refused reprising the role of Spock for what was essentially a cameo appearance; and his character\\'s lines were subsequently given to Scotty.\\nWhen recasting the role for 2009\\'s Star Trek, Nimoy was asked his opinion. He highlighted the work of Zachary Quinto, as he felt he looked similar and could portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto became the first actor to be cast for the film, and Nimoy agreed to return as the version of the character from the \"Prime\" universe. Nimoy said that he returned because of the enthusiasm from director J. J. Abrams and the writers, and because it made him feel appreciated. Nimoy made a final appearance as Spock in Star Trek Into Darkness as a favor to Abrams. At the time, he did not rule out returning again, but he died prior to the following film. In Star Trek Beyond, Quinto\\'s Spock mourns the loss of Spock Prime, as played by Nimoy.\\n\"Given the choice\", Nimoy said years after the show ended, \"if I had to be someone else, I would be Spock.\" He recalled, more than a decade after the show\\'s cancellation:\\nThe \"Star Trek\" phenomenon continues to amaze and confound me. It was incredible, and it still is, although it is gentler now than it used to be. For a time, it was hysterical\\xa0– it was so wild I had to be very careful where I went. If I went to a restaurant, I had to plan my entrances and my exits so I wouldn\\'t be mobbed and hurt. Same thing in hotels and airports\\xa0– any public place. It isn\\'t that hysterical any more, but it is still a potent force.From early on, the public reacted very positively—even fanatically—to his character, in what The Boston Globe in 1967 described as \"Spockmania\". Headshots of Spock became popular souvenirs, with the rare ones of the actor laughing the most valuable. Nimoy reported that \"within two weeks after [\"Amok Time\"], my mail jumped from a few hundred letters to 10,000 a week\". When he appeared as Spock as grand marshal of a Medford, Oregon parade in April 1967, thousands gathered to receive autographs: \"They surged forward so quickly that I was terrified someone would be crushed to death; and then they started pressing against the bandstand so hard it began to sway beneath my feet!\" After being rescued by police, \"I made sure never to appear publicly again in Vulcan guise\", Nimoy stated.\\nFans asked Nimoy questions about current events such as the Vietnam War and LSD as if he were the Vulcan scientist; one even asked the actor to lay his hands on a friend\\'s eyes to heal them. When a biracial girl wrote asking for advice on how to deal with persecution as \"a half-breed\", Nimoy responded that young Vulcans had treated Spock similarly and that she should, as he did, \"realize the difference between popularity and true greatness\". The actor believed that the character appealed to viewers, especially teenagers, because\\nSpock understands the trauma of human existence, for he is not home with earthmen or Vulcan; he can function only in the fabricated and neatly ordered society of the Enterprise. There, he knows who he is; he relates to his role very specifically, and this gives him a kind of cool.To Nimoy\\'s surprise, Spock became a sex symbol; Isaac Asimov described the character as \"a security blanket with sexual overtones\", and Nimoy reported that \"I\\'ve never had more female attention on a set before. And get this: they all want to touch the ears!\" (When a young woman asked \"Are you aware that you are the source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?\", he replied \"May all your dreams come true\".) Nimoy speculated that Spock appealed to women because\\nDown comes a stranger—tall, dark, thoughtful, alien and exotic. Somewhat devilish in appearance. He has a brilliant mind, the wisdom of a patriarch and is oh, so cool.\\nWith one raised eyebrow, he suggests he is above game-playing and role-playing—which are just hangovers from Earth\\'s Victorian Age—that he and he alone understands the deepest needs and longings of the Earth female.NASA made Spock an informal mascot. Nimoy was invited to be guest of honor at the March 1967 National Space Club dinner and to take an extensive tour of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The actor concluded from the warm and intense reception he received that astronauts like John Glenn and aerospace industry engineers, secretaries, and shareholders alike all regarded Star Trek, and especially the character of Spock, as a \"dramatization of the future of their space program\".[page\\xa0needed]\\nAn asteroid in the Eos family discovered on August 16, 1971 was named Mr. Spock after the discoverer James B. Gibson\\'s cat (which had been named Mr. Spock, who was likewise \"imperturbable, logical, intelligent, and had pointed ears\").\\nSpock proved inspirational to many budding scientists and engineers. Nimoy has said that many of them, on meeting him, were eager to show him their work and discuss it with him as if he were a scientific peer, as opposed to an actor, photographer, and poet. His stock response in these situations was \"it certainly looks like you\\'re headed in the right direction\".\\nIn 2004, Spock was ranked number 21 in Bravo\\'s list of The 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2008, UGO named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. According to Shatner, much of Star Trek\\'s acting praise and media interest went to Nimoy.\\nIn 2012, IGN ranked the character Spock, as depicted in the original series and the 2009 film Star Trek, as the second top character of the Star Trek universe, with Kirk in the top spot.\\nIn 2016, Adam Nimoy released his documentary film For the Love of Spock, about his father and his iconic character.\\nIn 2017, Screen Rant ranked Spock the 5th most attractive person in the Star Trek universe, in between Michael Burnham and Seven of Nine.

Although Paramount executives were concerned that Spock\\'s death would set fans against the movie, the audience actually applauded after Spock\\'s death scene. \"It was sensational. I hate to be given to superlatives but it absolutely reached everything we wanted it to. I couldn\\'t ask for anything better,\" said co-producer Robert Sallin of the advance audience\\'s reaction.\\nCritical reaction to Spock\\'s death was mixed. Film critic Roger Ebert lauded Spock\\'s death: \"He makes a choice in Star Trek II that would be made only by a hero, a fool, or a Vulcan. And when he makes his decision, the movie rises to one of its best scenes, because the Star Trek stories have always been best when they centered on their characters.\" On the other hand, The Washington Post\\'s Gary Arnold stated Spock\\'s death \"feels like an unnecessary twist, and the filmmakers are obviously well-prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel.\"\\nTwenty-five years later, Spock\\'s death in The Wrath of Khan ranks number 2 on Total Film\\'s list of 25 greatest Star Trek movie moments, and number 1 on IGN Movie\\'s top 10 Star Trek movie moments.\\nTy Burr of The Boston Globe described Quinto\\'s performance in the 2009 film as \"something special\", and stated that Nimoy\\'s appearance \"carries much more emotion than you\\'d expect\". Slate said Quinto played Spock \"with a few degrees more chill\" than Nimoy brought to the original character. Entertainment Weekly said that Quinto \"... invests Spock with a new layer of chilly-smoldering sex appeal, [and] Quinto does a fantastic job of maintaining Spock\\'s calm, no-sweat surface but getting quietly hot and bothered underneath.\"\\nSpock has been parodied by, and has also been the inspiration for, pop culture works in various media. Composer/keyboardist George Duke\\'s 1976 Solo Keyboard Album features two tracks which pay homage to Spock: \"Spock Gets Funky\" and \"Vulcan Mind Probe\". Rock guitarist Paul Gilbert wrote the song \"Mr. Spock\" on his Space Ship One album. Swedish synthpop band S.P.O.C.K makes music heavily influenced by the Star Trek universe. Assuming the Spock character, Nimoy recorded a number of novelty songs, the first being \"Highly Illogical\", in which Spock pointed out the foibles of human thought, such as relationships, automobiles, and greed. A second song, \"A Visit to a Sad Planet\", was darker in tone and told the story of Spock visiting Earth in the future and discovering it had been ruined by war, violence, and environmental irresponsibility. According to comic book writer and editor Bob Budiansky, The Transformers character Shockwave was inspired by Spock. Spock\\'s utilitarian perspective that \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\" is cited in a legal decision rendered by the Texas Supreme Court. Leonard Nimoy\\'s second-season Spock costume shirt was expected to sell at auction for over $75,000.\\nSpock\\'s physical appearance in the Original Series episode \"Mirror, Mirror\" (1967) has itself spawned a trope of the \"evil twin\" archetype found in various fictional genres. In that episode, several members of the Enterprise travel to a parallel universe inhabited by evil versions of themselves. The parallel universe version of Spock is distinguished physically by his goatee. Science fiction blog io9 said that Spock\\'s beard in the episode introduced \"the best shorthand ever for evil parallel universe duplicates\". Examples of the evil goatee\\'s appearances in other media include the host segments of episode 611 of the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000, Bender\\'s \"evil twin\" Flexo in Futurama, and a 2009 episode of The Colbert Report featuring Stephen Colbert and Dan Maffei wearing fake goatees while pretending to be evil versions of themselves.  The name of progressive rock band Spock\\'s Beard is a direct reference to Spock\\'s goatee in this episode.\\nIn addition to television, feature films, books, and parodies, Spock has also been portrayed in non-canon fan fiction. Since 2004, the online fan production Star Trek: New Voyages has continued the further voyages of the cancelled initial series. The fan-series\\' creators feel \"Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest should be treated as \\'classic\\' characters like Willy Loman from Death of a Salesman, Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, or even Hamlet, Othello, or Romeo. Many actors have and can play the roles, each offering a different interpretation of said character.\"\\nThe fan series Star Trek: New Voyages has featured three actors in the role of Spock. Spock was portrayed by Jeffrey Quinn for the pilot and first three episodes, by Ben Tolpin in episodes 4 and 5, and by Brandon Stacy in episodes 6 through 11. Stacy also served as a stand-in for Zachary Quinto in the 2009 Star Trek film.\\nThe independent online fan series Star Trek Continues featured Todd Haberkorn as Spock in three vignettes and eleven full episodes between 2013 and 2017.\\nIn scientific illustrator Jenny Parks\\' 2017 book Star Trek Cats, Spock is depicted as an Oriental Shorthair.\\n\\nThere has been a practice of altering the portrait of Wilfrid Laurier, Canada\\'s prime minister from 1896 to 1911, on Canadian five-dollar notes to look like Spock.

       "'He first appeared in the original Star Trek series serving aboard the starship USS Enterprise as science officer and first officer (and Kirk\\'s Second-in-command) and later as commanding officer of two iterations of the vessel. Spock\\'s mixed human-Vulcan heritage serves as an important plot element in many of the character\\'s appearances. Along with Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), he is one of the three central characters in the original Star Trek series and its films. Spock was played by Leonard Nimoy in the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: The Animated Series, eight of the Star Trek feature films, and a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Multiple actors have played the character since Nimoy within Star Trek\\'s main continuity; the most recent portrayal is Ethan Peck, who played Spock as a recurring character in the second season of Star Trek: Discovery and in Star Trek: Short Treks. Peck has reprised the role, this time as a main character, in the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, which acts as both a Discovery spin-off and a prequel to the original Star Trek series. Additionally, Zachary Quinto played an alternate reality version of Spock in the feature films Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and Star Trek Beyond (2016). Although the three films are set in the aforementioned parallel timeline, Nimoy appears in the first two as the original timeline\\'s Spock. Aside from the series and films in the Star Trek franchise, Spock has also appeared in numerous novels, comics, and video games. His public profile as Spock was so strong that both his autobiographies, I Am Not Spock (1975) and I Am Spock (1995), were written from the viewpoint of coexistence with the character. Spock\\'s backstory has been explained during the course of several episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series, the 2009 film Star Trek and the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \"Yesteryear\" . In Star Trek: Discovery, it is revealed that Spock has a human, adopted sister, Michael Burnham. According to the episode \"Amok Time\", Spock was betrothed to T\\'Pring (Arlene Martel) during his childhood. Sarek supported Spock\\'s scientific learning and application to the Vulcan Science Academy, as mentioned in \"Journey to Babel\". In the 2009 film Star Trek, Spock rejects his acceptance into the Vulcan Science Academy on the basis that they would never fully accept someone who was only half-Vulcan. Spock appeared as the science officer on the USS Enterprise in the first pilot for the series, \"The Cage\". This was not shown on television at the time, but the events of the episode were shown in the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\" of the first season, and Spock\\'s previous 11 years of service on the Enterprise were described. Spock did appear in the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", but this was broadcast initially as the third episode. The earliest appearance of Spock in the series as broadcast was \"The Man Trap\", the first such episode. Spock and Chief Engineer Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott (James Doohan) work together to rejoin the good and evil versions of the Captain, which had been split following a transporter accident. Spock is reunited with Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) in \"The Menagerie\". While the Enterprise is under threat in \"Balance of Terror\", Spock is accused by Lieutenant Stiles (Paul Comi) of knowing more about the Romulans than he admits when the alien\\'s similar physical appearance is revealed. Spock leads a landing party on the shuttlecraft Galileo in \"The Galileo Seven\", which is damaged and pulled off course and lands on the planet Taurus II. Spock is reunited with Leila Kalomi (Jill Ireland) in \"This Side of Paradise\"; after joining an away team to the planet Omicron Ceti III. Spock attempts to mind meld with a non-humanoid Horta in \"The Devil in the Dark\", having initially suggested that Kirk should kill the creature. Both Spock and Kirk undertake guerrilla warfare against the occupying Klingon forces on the planet Organia, prior to the establishment of the Organian Peace Treaty in \"Errand of Mercy\". To restore the timeline, he travels with Kirk back to 1930\\'s New York City in \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". In the premiere episode of the second season, \"Amok Time\", Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must undergo a ritual mating in the next eight days or die. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the Enterprise where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.During the course of the encounter with the Nomad space probe in \"The Changeling\", Spock undertakes a mind meld with the machine. Following a transporter accident which transports Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Scotty to a Mirror Universe and swaps them with their counterparts in the episode \"Mirror, Mirror\", they encounter a different version of Spock. At the beginning of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Spock is no longer in Starfleet, having resigned and returned home to pursue the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr. Spock, promoted to captain, is commanding officer of the Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). The sequel, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), focuses on his crewmates\\' quest to recover Spock\\'s body, learning upon arrival that he has been resurrected by the Genesis matrix after landing on the planet at the end of the previous film. At the film\\'s conclusion, Spock\\'s revived body is reunited with his katra. Spock is next seen in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), which depicts his recovery from the after-effects of his resurrection. In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989), Spock and the Enterprise crew confront the renegade Sybok, Spock\\'s half-brother. After a period in which the production team avoided mentioning some aspects of The Original Series, Spock was mentioned by name in Star Trek: The Next Generation in the episode \"Sarek\" (1990). Spock appears in \"Unification\" (1991), a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Set 75 years after the events of The Undiscovered Country, the episode focuses on Federation Ambassador Spock\\'s attempt to reunite the Romulans with their Vulcan brethren. Filming of The Undiscovered Country overlapped with production of this episode, and the episode references Spock\\'s role in the film. Spock\\'s next appearance in the live action Star Trek franchise is the 2009 Star Trek film. In the film\\'s flashback (set 19 years after the events of \"Unification\", and as depicted in the comic miniseries Star Trek: Countdown), Ambassador Spock (Nimoy) promises the Romulans he will use Vulcan technology to save them from a rogue supernova that threatens to destroy their Empire. In the film\\'s opening act, Nero\\'s ship emerges in the year 2233, and through its interaction with the inhabitants, inadvertently creates an \"alternate, parallel \\'Star Trek\\' universe\". Stranded in the alternate past, the prime version of Spock helps the alternate, younger version of himself and Kirk (Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, respectively) thwart Nero\\'s attempt to destroy the Federation. The film also features Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock\\'s childhood, including his abuse at the hands of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock\\'s initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls \"... a friendship that will define them both in ways they cannot yet realize.\" At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while his older self stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock\\'s home planet. In Star Trek Into Darkness, Spock Prime is described as living on \\'New Vulcan\\' while the younger Spock remains aboard the Enterprise struggling with the loss of his homeworld, as well as his relationships with Uhura and James T. Kirk. Spock Prime is contacted by Spock on the Enterprise, to find out details on Khan. That being said, he then informs Spock that Khan was a dangerous man, and the greatest threat that the Enterprise ever faced in his own timeline, and warns that he is likely as dangerous in Spock\\'s alternate timeline as well. When asked whether Khan was defeated, Spock Prime answers that he eventually was defeated, but at great cost (referring to the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). When Kirk contracts radiation poisoning and dies in front of Spock (a transposed parallel of events in the prime timeline where Spock dies in front of Kirk), an enraged and vengeful Spock attempts to kill Khan to avenge Kirk before Uhura informs him that Khan\\'s regenerative blood can revive Kirk. Nearly a year later, Spock remains as Kirk\\'s chief science officer and executive officer as the Enterprise departs on its first five-year mission of deep-space exploration. Into Darkness would be Nimoy\\'s final appearance as Spock Prime, as well as the last role of his career. In Star Trek Beyond, Spock receives word that Ambassador Spock (Spock Prime) has died. At the end of the film, Spock receives a box containing some of Ambassador Spock\\'s personal effects, and reflecting on a photograph of the older crew of the Enterprise from the series\\' original timeline, he chooses to remain in Starfleet. In August 2018 it was announced that Ethan Peck would join the cast of Star Trek: Discovery as Spock in the show\\'s second season, portraying a Spock younger than both Nimoy\\'s and Quinto\\'s renditions of the character, as Discovery is set several years before the Original Series and Kelvin Timeline films. Due to the trauma Spock suffered because of his visions of the \"Red Angel\", he is on leave from the Enterprise and under psychiatric care. The introduction to the second season episode \"If Memory Serves\" uses archival footage of Nimoy as Spock from the unaired pilot episode \"The Cage\", and the third season episode \"Unification III\" uses archival footage of Nimoy again from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Unification II\". The latter appearance is a holographic recording from the records of Jean-Luc Picard, and is shown to Michael Burnham after she travels to the 31st Century, a time in which the Romulan and Vulcan peoples remember Ambassador Spock as the cause of their reunification on the planet Ni\\'Var, the newly renamed Vulcan. In 2019, it was announced that the character Spock, as played by Peck would appear in two Star Trek: Short Treks, along with Captain Pike. He reprised the role in the episodes \"Q&A\" and \"Ask Not\". In May 2020, it was announced that Spock (Ethan Peck) would return in the series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds alongside Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and Number One / Una (Rebecca Romjin). The earliest known mention of Spock was in a conversation between Star Trek\\'s creator Gene Roddenberry and actor Gary Lockwood, in which Lockwood suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. The trio had previously worked together on Roddenberry\\'s The Lieutenant in the episode \"In the Highest Tradition\". At the time, Roddenberry sought DeForest Kelley to play the doctor character in the pilot, \"The Cage\", but both NBC executives and director Robert Butler wanted Kelley to play Spock. During an interview segment of TV Land\\'s 40th Anniversary Star Trek Marathon on November 12, 2006 Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry\\'s first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey\\'s close friend Ernest Borgnine writes in his autobiography, \"my hand to God – he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV\\'s Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\" Due to Roddenberry\\'s concern that a Mars landing might take place before the end of the series, Spock\\'s home planet was changed. Phillips in turn asked John Chambers to create Spock\\'s ears, as he was working on getting an appropriate shade of red for Spock\\'s skin; this idea was later abandoned in favor of a yellow hue because of the effects on black and white television. At Roddenberry\\'s insistence, Spock was the only character retained for the second pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". It was during early episodes such as \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" and \"The Naked Time\" that Nimoy came to understand the nature of the character. After eight episodes, NBC executives complained to Roddenberry that there was not enough Spock in the series; \"Spockmania\" had begun. In response, Spock was moved to a more prominent role within the series, such as taking the lead role in \"This Side of Paradise\" over Sulu. The character continued to develop, with Nimoy creating the Vulcan salute during the filming of \"Amok Time\". In particular, he did not like the character being made a fool of during the episode \"Spock\\'s Brain\". The interracial kiss between Kirk and Uhura in \"Plato\\'s Stepchildren\" had been intended by the writers to be between Spock and Uhura, but Shatner persuaded them to change it. For his role as Spock, Leonard Nimoy was nominated three times Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and is currently the only Star Trek actor to be nominated for an Emmy. Nimoy agreed to return to Spock during one of the early 1970s attempts to create a Star Trek film, entitled Star Trek: The God Thing, but dropped out after his likeness as Spock was used without permission to advertise Heineken beer. When the decision was made to turn the TV pilot script into Star Trek: The Motion Picture, director Robert Wise insisted Nimoy to return as the character, which was only accomplished by Jeffrey Katzenberg forcing Paramount to settle the dispute with Nimoy over licensing use of his image. Dissatisfied with the first Trek feature, Nimoy was reluctant to return for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan but was convinced by the promise of a dramatic death scene. The film\\'s success allowed Nimoy to successfully negotiate to direct the next installment in addition to briefly appearing as a reanimated Spock. The resulting film, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock was successful enough that Nimoy was asked to direct once more for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The following film of the series, the William Shatner-directed Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was initially unacceptable to Nimoy because it called for Spock to betray Kirk and side with his newly introduced half-brother Sybok. To hand over to Star Trek: The Next Generation at the time of The Undiscovered Country, Nimoy agreed to appear as Spock in the episode \"Unification\". Nimoy subsequently turned down the directing role on Star Trek Generations as he wanted to rework the script, and refused reprising the role of Spock for what was essentially a cameo appearance; and his character\\'s lines were subsequently given to Scotty. Nimoy made a final appearance as Spock in Star Trek Into Darkness as a favor to Abrams. In Star Trek Beyond, Quinto\\'s Spock mourns the loss of Spock Prime, as played by Nimoy. \"Given the choice\", Nimoy said years after the show ended, \"if I had to be someone else, I would be Spock.\" He recalled, more than a decade after the show\\'s cancellation:\\nThe \"Star Trek\" phenomenon continues to amaze and confound me. Nimoy reported that \"within two weeks after [\"Amok Time\"], my mail jumped from a few hundred letters to 10,000 a week\". When he appeared as Spock as grand marshal of a Medford, Oregon parade in April 1967, thousands gathered to receive autographs: \"They surged forward so quickly that I was terrified someone would be crushed to death; and then they started pressing against the bandstand so hard it began to sway beneath my feet!\" When a biracial girl wrote asking for advice on how to deal with persecution as \"a half-breed\", Nimoy responded that young Vulcans had treated Spock similarly and that she should, as he did, \"realize the difference between popularity and true greatness\". The actor believed that the character appealed to viewers, especially teenagers, because\\nSpock understands the trauma of human existence, for he is not home with earthmen or Vulcan; he can function only in the fabricated and neatly ordered society of the Enterprise. There, he knows who he is; he relates to his role very specifically, and this gives him a kind of cool.To Nimoy\\'s surprise, Spock became a sex symbol; Isaac Asimov described the character as \"a security blanket with sexual overtones\", and Nimoy reported that \"I\\'ve never had more female attention on a set before.

       " 'Argentine professional footballer\\nEponyms and public art\\nFilms\\nFamily\\nLionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation:\\xa0[ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for  Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d\\'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He has also the most international goals by a South American male (98). Messi has scored over 795 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672).\\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain at the age of 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d\\'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d\\'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for appearances and is also the country\\'s all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad\\'s captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or in 2021. In 2022, he captained his country to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball for a record second time, and broke the record for most appearances in World Cup tournaments with 26 matches played.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1\\xa0billion in career earnings.\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father\\'s side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother\\'s side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \"Leo\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.\\n\"When you saw him you would think: this kid can\\'t play ball. He\\'s a dwarf, he\\'s too fragile, too small. But immediately you\\'d realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.\"\\n– Newell\\'s Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell\\'s, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of \\'87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team\\'s home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father\\'s health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell\\'s agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment. His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I\\'ve ever seen\".\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club\\'s stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell\\'s; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.\\nAfter a year at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona\\'s greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.\\n\"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.\"\\n– Barcelona\\'s then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi\\'s first-team debut.\\nDuring the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club\\'s ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard\\'s first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team\\'s starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"\\nAt 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho\\'s Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club\\'s reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça\\'s new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.\\nTo gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla\\'s Sergio Ramos. His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30\\xa0million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80\\xa0million. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.\\nDuring the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions. Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player\\'s wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot. Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club. Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.\\n\"In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the \\'heavy\\' shirt of one of the world\\'s great clubs.\"\\n– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.\\nOn 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150\\xa0million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona\\'s pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello\\'s Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.  Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150\\xa0million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.\\nDue to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto\\'o. He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona\\'s away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League, which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, \"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\" After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League, in a 5–0 win over Panathinaikos on 2 November 2005, his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team\\'s victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.\\nWhile Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign. Already an idol to the culés, the club\\'s supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions. However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months. He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition. In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games. On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time. His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.\\nAlready frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona\\'s two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona\\'s second goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\\xa0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done. A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona\\'s Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match. As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.\\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça\\'s new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media. His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká. Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign, the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December. He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition\\'s top scorer at that point with six goals, but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match. Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.\\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter\\'s departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt. He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8\\xa0million, becoming the club\\'s highest-paid player. Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential. Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nIn his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside Eto\\'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club. During his first season under Barcelona\\'s new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side\\'s first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team\\'s greatest-ever score at Real Madrid\\'s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey. With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.\\nAs the season\\'s Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament\\'s history, Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich. He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football. This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250\\xa0million, while his salary increased to €12\\xa0million.\\nHis team\\'s prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year. After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting margin in each trophy\\'s history.\\n\"Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He\\'s [like] a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make.\"\\n– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.\\nThe new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16. Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club\\'s summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimović occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola\\'s team, and his goalscoring rate increased. Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo\\'s club record from the 1996–97 campaign. He scored all of his side\\'s four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in the competition. Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year. As the league\\'s top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo\\'s record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.\\nMessi secured Barcelona\\'s first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side\\'s second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat. Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0. Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011. His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Under the award\\'s old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.\\nTowards the end of the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in the span of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side\\'s 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition. Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final, where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition\\'s top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça\\'s 3–1 victory. Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league\\'s top assist provider with 18. He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.\\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant), he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions. He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition\\'s all-time top scorer with eight goals. At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously. For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d\\'Or. By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.\\n\"I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi\\'s throne – it\\'s impossible, this kid is unique.\"\\n– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer at the age of 24 in March 2012\\nAs Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition. In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end. Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar. In Barça\\'s last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller\\'s 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.\\nUnder manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition\\'s midway point, a record in Spanish football. A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez\\'s record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller\\'s record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany. Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed \"with respect and admiration\", after breaking his 40-year record. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year. As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or four times.\\nBarcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid\\'s 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova\\'s absence due to ill health. After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi. Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13\\xa0million. He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team\\'s tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff. Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team\\'s attack had increased; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.\\n\"In Leo we are talking about the best player in the world and when things are not going well you have to use him. Even if he is half lame, his presence on the pitch is enough to lift us and our play in general.\"\\n– Defender Gerard Piqué explains Barcelona\\'s reliance on an unfit Messi against Paris Saint-Germain in April 2013.\\nAfter four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona\\'s perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.\\nMessi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist. Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times. Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months. Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.\\nDuring the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons. He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano. Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions. For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou. After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20\\xa0million, or €36\\xa0million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport. It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay amid strong interest from Mourinho\\'s Chelsea.\\nUnder new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year. A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra. A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals. Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.\\nAt the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça\\'s attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run. After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker. From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team\\'s attacking dependency on their star player. With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.\\nTowards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title. Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football. As the season\\'s top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 3] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick. Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.\\nIn the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola. His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year\\'s most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA. Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so. Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side\\'s goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound. In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons. For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.\\nMessi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona\\'s 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup. On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma. After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona\\'s 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico. Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama. On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.\\nOn 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or for a record fifth time in his career. On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona\\'s 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou. In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as \"a touch of genius\", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, \"Barca\\'s forwards are very respectful.\" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was \"very happy\" with the play, insisting \"it was legal and entertaining\".\\nOn 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 1–3 away win against Sporting de Gijón. A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona\\'s 0–2 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona\\'s 10,000th in official competitions. On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona\\'s 2–1 home loss to Valencia. Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona\\'s 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season. In total, Messi scored 41 goals as Barcelona\\'s attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.\\n\"[Messi] is indispensable, but the rest of us are dispensable. – No, the club is bigger than any manager, than any player... except Leo. That\\'s the reality, and you have to accept it.\"\\n– In an interview with Barcelona\\'s official magazine, Javier Mascherano outlines Messi\\'s importance to the team.\\nMessi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona\\'s captain in the absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta; he set-up Munir\\'s goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August, and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August. Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6–2 against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season. On 13 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi\\'s sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player. A week later, Messi sustained a groin injury in a 1–1 draw against Atlético Madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks. He marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4–0 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña, on 16 October. Three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as Barcelona defeated Manchester City 4–0. On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona\\'s 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl.\\nMessi finished the year with 51 goals, making him Europe\\'s top scorer, one ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimović. After placing second in the 2016 Ballon d\\'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also finished in second place – behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player Award. On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona\\'s 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club\\'s all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman. In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl\\'s record for the most teams scored against in La Liga (35).\\nOn 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club\\'s all-time top-scorer from free-kicks. On 23 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his 500th for Barcelona.

Thereby, Messi also extended his El Clásico goalscoring record with the goal being his 24th official and 25th overall.\\nOn 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in Derbi barceloní, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals. Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season\\'s Italian champions Juventus 3–0 at home in the UEFA Champions League. On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga. Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club\\'s history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets\\' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.\\nOn 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3–1 home victory over Olympiacos. Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart. On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2–1 home win over Sevilla in La Liga. Following the reception of his fourth Golden Boot, Messi signed a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November, keeping him with the club through the 2020–21 season. His buyout clause was set at €700\\xa0million. On 7 January 2018, Messi made his 400th La Liga appearance with Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal Gerd Müller\\'s record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of Europe\\'s top five divisions. A week later, he broke the record, scoring his 366th La Liga goal from a free kick in a 4–2 away win against Real Sociedad.\\nOn 4 March, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1–0 home win over Atlético Madrid, in La Liga.

His opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of his career, as Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition for the eleventh consecutive season. On 7 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Leganés including his sixth goal scored from a free-kick for the season, matching the record set by former teammate Ronaldinho. He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth Golden Shoe award. On 21 April, Messi scored Barcelona\\'s second goal – his 40th of the season – in a 5–0 win over Sevilla in the 2018 Copa del Rey Final, later also setting up Suárez\\'s second goal; this was Barcelona\\'s fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall.

On 15 August, Messi suffered his worst defeat as a player as Bayern Munich beat Barcelona 8–2 in a one-off tie in Lisbon, leading to another disappointing exit from the Champions League.\\n\"I wasn\\'t happy and I wanted to leave. I have not been allowed this in any way and I will stay at the club so as not to get into a legal dispute. The management of the club led by Bartomeu is a disaster. My love for Barça will never change.\"\\n– Messi on reversing his decision to leave Barcelona in an interview with Goal on 4 September 2020.\\nFollowing growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field, Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club \"a document expressing his desire to leave\" on 25 August 2020. The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi\\'s statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra. On 26 August, Barcelona\\'s sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club\\'s desire to \"build a team around the most important player in the world\" and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700\\xa0million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi\\'s contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player\\'s representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season. On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi\\'s contract and buyout clause were still active.\\nOn 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel\\'s father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause \"is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player\\'s unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season\", as stated in Messi\\'s contract with Barcelona; moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August. Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause. This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying \"I would never go to court against the club of my life\".\\nOn 27 September, Messi began the 2020–21 season by scoring a penalty in a 4–0 home win against Villarreal in La Liga. Two days prior to the opening game, he again criticised the club, this time for the manner of Luis Suárez\\'s departure, stating, \"at this stage nothing surprises me any more\". On 20 October, Messi scored a penalty in a 5–1 home victory against Ferencváros in the Champions League, becoming the first player in history to score in sixteen consecutive Champions League seasons. On 25 November, Messi was nominated for the 2020 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player award, and was later shortlisted as one of the final three candidates. On 29 November, Messi scored his side\\'s fourth goal in their 4–0 victory over Osasuna. After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell\\'s Old Boys, in tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both hands to the screen showing Maradona\\'s face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993. On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.\\n\"Congratulations on your historic record, Lionel. But above all, congratulations on your beautiful career at Barcelona. Stories like ours, of loving the same club for so long, unfortunately will be increasingly rare in football. I admire you very much, Leo Messi.\"\\n– Pelé congratulates Messi after he overtook his record in scoring the most goals for a club.\\nOn 23 December, Messi scored his 644th goal for Barcelona against Real Valladolid in La Liga, surpassing Pelé with Santos as the player with the most goals scored for a single club. In order to celebrate his achievement, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against. On 17 January 2021, Messi was sent off for the first time in his club career for violent conduct (swinging an arm at the head of Asier Villalibre, missed initially by the referee but reviewed via VAR) in the final minutes of Barcelona\\'s 2–3 extra time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the 2020–21 Supercopa de España Final. On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1–1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2–5 after having lost 1–4 at home on 16 February, with Messi scoring Barcelona\\'s only goal in that game.

With his second goal, he broke Gerd Müller\\'s record of 30 plus goals in 12 consecutive club seasons, setting a new record of 13. With his 35th trophy with Barcelona, Messi also overtook former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs as the most decorated footballer for a single club. On 16 May, Messi scored his 30th league goal of the campaign in a 1–2 home defeat against Celta Vigo, which later turned out to be his final goal and match in a Barcelona shirt. The top goalscorer in La Liga, Messi received the Pichichi trophy for a record eighth time in his career. It was also his record fifth consecutive win in La Liga, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano and Hugo Sánchez who both had four for Real Madrid.\\n\"Leo wanted to stay and the Club wanted him to stay but with the La Liga rules it has not been possible. To comply with the league\\'s fair play regulations we had to accept an agreement that mortgaged the Club\\'s TV right for half a century and FC Barcelona is above everything else.\"\\n– Barcelona president Joan Laporta explains the reason behind Messi\\'s departure.\\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired, with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona. On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day. The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi\\'s departure. Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi\\'s exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\". Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.\\nOn 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain. He signed a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year. Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.\\nMessi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of a 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1. He made his first start and Champions League debut for the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September. Four days later, Messi made his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon. On 28 September, he scored his first goal for the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box in a 2–0 Champions League group stage win over Pep Guardiola\\'s Manchester City. On 21 November, Messi scored his first Ligue 1 goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes. Later that month, he provided a hat-trick of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home. Having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or on 29 November.\\n\"I think about being able to reverse the situation, about not having the feeling of having changed clubs and that it didn\\'t go well for me. I\\'m already prepared for what\\'s to come, I know the club, I know the city, I\\'m a little more comfortable with the dressing room, with my teammates and I know it\\'s going to be different.\"\\n– Messi on his difficult first season at PSG and how he wants to improve in his second season in an interview with TyC Sports.\\nOn 2 January 2022, PSG announced that Messi had tested positive for COVID-19, missing two league games and a cup game as a result. He made his return against on 23 January in the league against Reims where he came on as a substitute in the second half and assisted PSG\\'s third goal in a 4–0 home victory. On 13 March, following their Champions League elimination against Real Madrid in the round of 16, Messi and his team-mate Neymar were booed by some of the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes in the league match against Bordeaux. Then-PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino defended Messi by saying \"To judge Messi in this way is unfair,\" adding \"It was a year of learning, and not just on a professional level coming to Paris Saint-Germain, in a new league and with new teammates, but also on a family level.\" On 23 April, he helped PSG clinch their 10th Ligue 1 title after scoring from a strike outside the 18-yard box in a 1–1 draw against Lens at home. Messi finished his debut season with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions. He failed to reach double figure league goals for the first time since 2005–06, ending the campaign with 6.\\nAfter adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in a attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31 July by scoring PSG\\'s first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions, winning his second trophy with PSG.\\nDue to his previous form last season, Messi was not nominated for the Ballon d\\'Or award for the first time since 2005. On 21 August, Messi provided a long-range assist for Mbappé, clocked at eight seconds, for Ligue 1\\'s second-fastest goal ever scored, before also scoring a goal in 7–1 away win over Lille. The following matches, after registering six goal contributions, including one goal and five assists, Messi was named Ligue 1\\'s Player of the Month in September. On 5 October, he scored in a 1–1 draw away to Benfica in the Champions League, becoming the only player in the competition\\'s history to score against 40 different Champions League opponents. On 25 October, he scored twice in a 7–2 Champions League win at home to Maccabi Haifa, setting the record for the most goals scored from outside the 18-yard box than any other player in the competition, with 23 goals. Four days later, Messi scored and provided an assist as PSG won 4–3 against Troyes to remain top of the Ligue 1 table. The goal was his seventh of the league season and his twelfth overall, surpassing his total output of eleven goals in all competitions during the 2021–22 season in just 18 matches.\\nAs a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries. Selectors for Spain\\'s Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona\\'s director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.\\nAware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad\\'s senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina\\'s fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.\\nIn recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off. He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his \"re-debut\" ahead of the match. Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as \"a jewel\". He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina\\'s participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman\\'s squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.\\nDuring the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes\\' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup. As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential. In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout. Back home, Pékerman\\'s decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina\\'s favour.\\nAs Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile\\'s starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela. He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico\\'s goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win. In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation\\'s best players. Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme. He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.\\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches. After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista\\'s under-23 squad in Beijing. During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals. Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament\\'s best team.\\nFrom late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona\\'s stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela. During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina\\'s number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme. Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.\\nDespite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria\\'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side\\'s 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched. He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.\\nArgentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974. FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament\\'s 10 best players, citing his \"outstanding\" pace and creativity and \"spectacular and efficient\" dribbling, shooting and passing. Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.\\nMaradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina\\'s Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona. Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009. Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team\\'s supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.\\nAfter Argentina\\'s unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team\\'s on-field leader and motivator. In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.\\nUnder Sabella, Messi\\'s goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years. He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country. His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina\\'s second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign. Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.\\nAhead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches. In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac\\'s own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier. During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase. He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group. Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team\\'s first penalty.\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world\\'s best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona. Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup. At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition. However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.\\nAnother final appearance, the third of Messi\\'s senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup. During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone. In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.\\nAs Messi evolved from the team\\'s symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners. In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia\\'s goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team\\'s first spot kick. At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side\\'s 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd. Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty. At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour. As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.\\nMessi\\'s place in Argentina\\'s Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016. It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina\\'s 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness. Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation\\'s second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero\\'s goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina\\'s place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.\\n\"Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, \\'he\\'s the top scorer for the Argentina national team.\\' But the advantage I have is that I\\'m second to an extraterrestrial.\"\\n– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.\\nOn 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance, assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta\\'s national record of 54 goals in official international matches. This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year, and was named man of the match once again.\\nDuring a repeat of the previous year\\'s final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi\\'s third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. He stated, \"I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.\" Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, \"My generation can\\'t compare him to Maradona that\\'s for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\" Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.\\nFollowing his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring. He was greeted by fans with signs like \"Don\\'t go, Leo\" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, \"We are lucky, it is one of life\\'s pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\" Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement. The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.\\n\"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.\"\\n– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016\\nJust a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September. On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team\\'s upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers. On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.\\nOn 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000. On 5 May, Messi\\'s four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina\\'s remaining World Cup Qualifiers. Argentina\\'s place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001. Messi\\'s three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay\\'s Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.\\n\"The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]\"\\n– Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.\\nFollowing on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018. Prior to Argentina\\'s opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi\\'s final World Cup. In the team\\'s opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw. In Argentina\\'s second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying \"we quite simply couldn\\'t pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle\". Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, \"Messi is an incredible player but he can\\'t do everything alone.\"\\nIn Argentina\\'s final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties. A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot. He was awarded Man of the Match. Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia. In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado\\'s and Sergio Agüero\\'s goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup. With his two assists in his team\\'s second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.\\nFollowing the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina\\'s friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi\\'s absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again. In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team\\'s friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month. A conversation with Scaloni and his idol Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire. He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.\\nOn 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni\\'s final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América. In Argentina\\'s second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay. After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina\\'s 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches. Following Argentina\\'s 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match, and alleged the competition was \"set up\" for Brazil to win.\\nIn the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero\\'s opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender. Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off. Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina\\'s next World Cup qualifier. On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee\\'s decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina\\'s friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October. On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty. On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.\\n\"It was clear to me that I had to try until the last tournament and that I couldn\\'t withdraw from the national team without winning something.\"\\n– Messi on winning the 2021 Copa América in an interview with Diario Sport.\\nOn 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina\\'s opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil. On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano\\'s record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament. A week later, he broke the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team\\'s final group match, assisting Papu Gómez\\'s opening goal and later scoring two. On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition. On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina\\'s eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final. On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina\\'s first since 1993, as well as his nation\\'s joint record 15th Copa América overall. Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament\\'s top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia\\'s Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.\\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America\\'s top male international scorer with 79 goals. In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level. Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men\\'s top scorers.\\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina\\'s opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández\\'s goal. In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina\\'s 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance, and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador\\'s Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records. In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina\\'s first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty. In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany\\'s Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina\\'s third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win; with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina\\'s all–time top–scorer at the World Cup. Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.\\nIn the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup finals appearance at Lusail Stadium. Messi scored Argentina\\'s opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in each round of a single World Cup edition. After Argentina\\'s eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina\\'s lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina\\'s first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation\\'s 36-year wait for the trophy. Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé. With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists). The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé. Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying \"I want to continue playing as a champion.\"\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (\"The Atomic Flea\"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\" Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of October 2022, Messi ranks 9th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 60, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.\\nMessi\\'s pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \"The ball stays glued to his foot; I\\'ve seen great players in my career, but I\\'ve never seen anyone with Messi\\'s ball control.\" Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates\\' attacking runs off the ball, Messi\\'s own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager\\'s 4–3–3 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1, or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team\\'s attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.\\n\"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.\"\\n– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world\\'s best players before age 20. Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d\\'Or, commented, \"I\\'m not even the best at Barça\", in reference to his protégé. Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d\\'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Barça\\'s second treble-winning season, Messi\\'s superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \"New Maradona\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\" César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \"at the level of the best Maradona\". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.\\nIn Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\". Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\" Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi\\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability. Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \"more one of the group, more Argentine\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world. Since 2008, Messi has won seven Ballons d\\'Or to Ronaldo\\'s five, six FIFA World\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\'s four. Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players. Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87\\xa0m (6\\xa0ft 1+1⁄2\\xa0in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo\\'s self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi\\'s humility. From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world\\'s most viewed annual sports events. Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.\\nAccording to France Football, Messi was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40\\xa0million benchmark, with earnings of €41\\xa0million in 2013, and the €50–€60\\xa0million points, with income of €65\\xa0million in 2014. Messi was second on Forbes list of the world\\'s highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4\\xa0million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. Forbes ranked him the world\\'s highest-paid athlete in 2019. From 2008, he was Barcelona\\'s highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8\\xa0million to €13\\xa0million over the next five years. Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6\\xa0million as a signing on bonus. His buyout clause was set at $835\\xa0million (€700\\xa0million). In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1\\xa0billion in earnings during their careers.\\nIn addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world\\'s most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona\\'s leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival\\'s claim to his image rights in court. Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi. Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz. In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi\\'s name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi\\'s marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami\\'s video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\\nMessi\\'s global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world\\'s most influential people as published by Time, in 2011 and 2012. His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi\\'s Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by August 2021 he had over 103 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. He also has over 400 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo. His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes. According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players. On Messi\\'s economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".\\nOther events have illustrated Messi\\'s presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25\\xa0kg (55\\xa0lb) and valued at $5.25\\xa0million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. A 2013 Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137 million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube\\'s founding. World Press Photo selected \"The Final Game\", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina\\'s final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014. Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\" In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia\\'s tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia\\'s poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing. In August 2022, Messi was urged by the family of Mohammed al Faraj to intervene on their son\\'s behalf after he was arrested in 2017 at the age of 15 for crimes against the Saudi regime and faced the death penalty.\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.\\n\"Leo is not shy. He\\'s introverted. He\\'s reserved.\"\\n— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 4] who addressed Messi\\'s growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner\\'s first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina\\'s 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012. In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario. In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child. Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.\\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family\\'s old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of \\'87\" at Newell\\'s Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell\\'s embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son. Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell\\'s. Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain. His favourite meals include asado (traditional South American barbecue), milanesa and pasta, and he prefers his mate unsweetened.\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country\\'s children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son\\'s first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world. In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell\\'s Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. At Newell\\'s Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club\\'s stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell\\'s, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières. Messi made a donation worth €1\\xa0million ($1.1\\xa0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus. This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina. In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team\\'s security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members. In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d\\'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé\\'s record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America\\'s football players. A deal brokered by Uruguay\\'s president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones in Uruguay remarking that \"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\".\\nMessi\\'s financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1\\xa0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1\\xa0million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7\\xa0million and €1.4\\xa0million in fines. Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\"\\nBarcelona\\nParis Saint-Germain\\nArgentina U20\\nArgentina U23\\nArgentina\\nIndividual\\nBibliography')"

      "Messi has scored over 795 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672). The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. He scored all of his side's four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in the competition. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition. At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times. On 21 April, Messi scored Barcelona's second goal – his 40th of the season – in a 5–0 win over Sevilla in the 2018 Copa del Rey Final, later also setting up Suárez's second goal; this was Barcelona's fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall. On 23 February, Messi scored the 50th hat-trick of his career and also provided an assist for Suárez, as he helped Barcelona come from behind to achieve a 4–2 away victory over Sevilla in La Liga; the goal was also his 650th career goal for club and country at senior level. On 16 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home victory over Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-finals to give Barcelona a 4–0 aggregate win, which saw Barcelona progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2015; these were also his first goals in the Champions League quarter-finals since 2013. On 1 May, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home win over Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals; his second goal of the match, a 35-yard free kick, was the 600th senior club goal of his career, all of which had been scored with Barcelona. On 19 May, in Barcelona's final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 away draw against Eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, he equalled Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga. Messi made his first appearance of the season on 17 September, and on 6 October he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4–0 home win over Sevilla; this was his 420th goal in La Liga, which saw him break Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 419 goals scored in Europe's top five leagues. On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1–1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2–5 after having lost 1–4 at home on 16 February, with Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years. During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year, and was named man of the match once again. With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists). Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \"The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\"\n",

      "He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League, which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, \"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\" After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition. Messi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta; he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August, and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August. On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman. On 16 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home victory over Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-finals to give Barcelona a 4–0 aggregate win, which saw Barcelona progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2015; these were also his first goals in the Champions League quarter-finals since 2013. On 19 May, in Barcelona's final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 away draw against Eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, he equalled Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga. On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi's record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009; with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe's top-five leagues. Following his brace in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid. On 26 August, Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club's desire to \"build a team around the most important player in the world\" and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi's contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player's representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season. On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel's father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause \"is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player's unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season\", as stated in Messi's contract with Barcelona; moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August. On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1–1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2–5 after having lost 1–4 at home on 16 February, with Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game. After adjusting to his new surroundings and settling in Paris, under new coach Christophe Galtier, Messi returned to his preferred free attacking role; being placed in his favoured position as the playmaker behind two strikers, in a attacking trident with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, quickly regaining his form from his previous season by starting off the new season on 31 July by scoring PSG's first goal in a 4–0 victory over Nantes in the Trophée des Champions, winning his second trophy with PSG. Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance. Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez. In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties. On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1, or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez. An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.\n",

      "As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months. Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011. In Barça's last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona's 2–1 home loss to Valencia. On 1 November, Messi scored his 54th Champions League group stage goal in Barcelona's 3–1 away loss to Manchester City, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by Raúl. On 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in Derbi barceloní, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals. It was also his record fifth consecutive win in La Liga, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano and Hugo Sánchez who both had four for Real Madrid. Later that month, he provided a hat-trick of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, \"Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone.\" Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi \"was always seen as more Catalan than one of them\". From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players. On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.\n",

On 11 January, Messi scored from a free-kick in Barcelona's 3–1 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which enabled Barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for Barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by Ronald Koeman. Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum. On 7 January 2018, Messi made his 400th La Liga appearance with Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal Gerd Müller's record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of Europe's top five divisions. On 16 April, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home victory over Manchester United in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-finals to give Barcelona a 4–0 aggregate win, which saw Barcelona progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2015; these were also his first goals in the Champions League quarter-finals since 2013. On 19 May, in Barcelona's final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 away draw against Eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, he equalled Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga. Messi made his first appearance of the season on 17 September, and on 6 October he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4–0 home win over Sevilla; this was his 420th goal in La Liga, which saw him break Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 419 goals scored in Europe's top five leagues. On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi's record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009; with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe's top-five leagues.

Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1, or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.

In the 2000s, he sparked controversy with his criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, his efforts to promote Scientology in Europe, and a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.\\nCruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films. Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\", a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. He elaborated, \"[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he\\'d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, \\'There\\'s something wrong with this guy. Don\\'t trust him. Be careful around him.\\'\"\\nIn total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years. Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that \"the movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble piece.\" In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South. Cruise\\'s biological father died of cancer in 1984. Cruise briefly took a Catholic Church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a Franciscan priest before being expelled from the seminary for drinking. This led to his becoming interested in acting.:\\u200a24–26\\u200a In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.:\\u200a47\\u200a He went on to star in the school\\'s production of Guys and Dolls. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\\nAt age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films. He first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise.\" He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985. By 1986\\'s Top Gun, his status as a superstar had been cemented.\\nCruise followed up Top Gun with Martin Scorsese\\'s The Color of Money (1986), which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. Their chemistry won praise among critics with The Washington Post writing, \"One of the subtle achievements of both Cruise\\'s and Newman\\'s performances is that you feel that both of them are genuinely top-notch pool hustlers\". In 1988, Cruise starred in Cocktail, a film that was a box office success but failed with critics. His performance earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Barry Levinson\\'s Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor.\\nIn 1989, Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone\\'s war epic Born on the Fourth of July. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Nothing Cruise has done will prepare you for what he does in Born on the Fourth of July\\xa0... His performance is so good that the movie lives through it. Stone is able to make his statement with Cruise\\'s face and voice and doesn\\'t need to put everything into the dialogue.\" The performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor –  Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise\\'s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.\\nCruise\\'s next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan\\'s Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice\\'s best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.\\nIn 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. The film was directed by Brian De Palma and was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series. Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Cruise\\'s performance, declaring \"Tom Cruise has found the perfect superhero character on which to graft his breathlessly gung-ho screen personality.\" In the same year, Cruise took on the title role in Cameron Crowe\\'s sports drama Jerry Maguire playing a sports agent in search of love. He stars opposite Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. The film was a massive financial success with Cruise earning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor.\\nIn 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in Stanley Kubrick\\'s erotic and psychological drama film Eyes Wide Shut. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised both Cruise and Kidman on their performances writing, \"Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor\". That same year he took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s Magnolia (1999). Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers heaped praise on Cruise writing, \"Cruise is a revelation, fully deserving of the shower of superlatives coming his way\\xa0... Cruise seethes with the chaotic energy of a wounded animal – he\\'s devastating.\" For his performance he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.\\nIn 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style; it continued the series\\' success at the box office, taking in $547 million worldwide. Unlike its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for the film.\\nHis next five films were major critical and commercial successes. The following year, Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report, which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.\\nIn 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick\\'s period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral. The critical consensus states that \"Driven by director Michael Mann\\'s trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.\" In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4\\xa0million worldwide. Also in 2005, he was a nominee for the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the winner of the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100\\xa0million at the box office.\\nIn 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400\\xa0million at the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008, to box office success.\\nIn March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to that date.\\nOn May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages (2012), in which he played the fictional character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012 and was a rare box-office misstep for Cruise. Cruise however received positive reviews for his performance with Variety\\'s film critic Justin Chang writing, \"Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos, heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow, Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his world\\'s-biggest-movie-star identity, displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers haven\\'t seen since his turn in Magnolia.\"\\nCruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012. It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $217 million worldwide. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski\\'s graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $286 million worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews and grossed over $370 million.\\nIn 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced. Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success. Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff\\'s 1932 horror movie The Mummy. The new film, also titled The Mummy received negative reviews and flopped at the box office. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed over $791 million at the box office. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to date.\\nIn May 2020, it was reported that Cruise would be starring in and producing a movie shot in outer space. Doug Liman would be directing, writing, and co-producing. Both will fly to the International Space Station as part of a future Axiom Space mission in a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft.\\nIn May 2021, Cruise protested against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by returning all three of his Golden Globe Awards in light of controversy surrounding the HFPA, particularly its lack of diversity, specifically no black members, and ethical questions related to financial benefits to some of its members.\\nIn 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in Top Gun: Maverick, a film which he also executive produced. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Cruise earned an Honorary Palme d\\'Or. The film was released to widespread critical praise, with many reviewers deeming it superior to its predecessor. The film broke several box office records upon its release; earning over $1 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of his career. Cruise earned $100 million for the film, when combining ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenues.\\nCruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise\\'s films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise\\'s first project as a producer.\\nCruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise\\'s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise\\'s exceptional commercial prowess.\\nCruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise\\'s film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson\\'s New York Times bestseller The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago\\'s World\\'s Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World\\'s Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.\\nCruise has produced several films in which he appeared. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.\\nOn August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In The Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount\\'s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise\\'s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount\\'s announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.\\nIndustry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount\\'s discontent over Cruise/Wagner\\'s exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.\\nIn November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists. Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA\\'s chief executive.\\nProduction began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,[citation needed] opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.\\nIn August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise\\'s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.\\nCruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Clearwater, Florida; and the South of England where Cruise has lived in various places including Central London, Dulwich, East Grinstead, and Biggin Hill.\\nIn the early-to-mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with Melissa Gilbert, Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher.\\nCruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987. They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers had grown up in Scientology and was one of its \\'auditors\\'; they met when Cruise became one of her clients. After she left the organization, she blamed its leader, David Miscavige, for the break-up of their marriage.\\nCruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy seemingly ended in a miscarriage, but in 2007, Kidman clarified the rumors by explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.\\nCruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). Their three-year relationship ended in 2004. An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with Iranian-British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology. Scientology and Cruise\\'s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\". Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.\\nIn April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed TomKat by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show; he jumped on Winfrey\\'s yellow couch and stood there. Media coverage at the time implied that Oprah was somewhat taken aback by Cruise\\'s outburst, which distracted from the intended promotion of Cruise\\'s current film, War of the Worlds.[citation needed] On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child. In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. Their publicists said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise\\'s best man. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available. Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple\\'s daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization.\\nCruise was converted to Scientology by his first wife Mimi Rogers in 1986, becoming an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology in the 2000s. His involvement in the organization was leaked by the tabloid Star in 1990, and he publicly admitted to following Scientology in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters. According to the book Inside Scientology: The Story of America\\'s Most Secretive Religion by Janet Reitman, seven years after Cruise started studying Scientology, the organization\\'s leaders promised to share Scientology secrets, such as the prophet Xenu. According to Reitman\\'s book, Cruise \"freaked out\" and took a step back. He removed himself from the Church and worked on the film Eyes Wide Shut until 1999 when David Miscavige sent Marty Rathbun to successfully \"retrieve\" Cruise and convince him to continue training. Cruise had become a full-on zealot after a couple of years. Cruise is friends with the Scientology organization\\'s chairman David Miscavige. Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.\\nIn addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be afforded the status of a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin. They described him as a militant spokesman for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him. He lobbied British Prime Minister Tony Blair to recognize the Scientology organization as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] In the United States, he convinced Bush administration officials Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Scooter Libby to oppose the non-recognition of Scientology in Germany in 2003.[citation needed] In 2004, he met Secretary of Education Rod Paige about endorsing Scientologist education methods as part of No Child Left Behind.[citation needed]\\nCruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from medical professionals and firefighters. For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004. Former Scientologist Paul Haggis also claimed that Cruise attempted to convert celebrities such as James Packer, Victoria and David Beckham, Jada Pinkett and Will Smith, and Steven Spielberg to Scientology.\\nIn January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement: \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" Further controversy ensued in 2005, when he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.\" This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBC\\'s Today on June 24, 2005.\\nMedical authorities view Cruise\\'s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. From The Lancet, \"He may be right that psychotropic drugs are overused, sometimes misused; and that lifestyle changes (and exercise for depression) can be helpful. But he is wrong, as a celebrity, to add to the burden of those with a mental illness, who often fear seeking or continuing treatment because of the stigma still attached to their condition.\" Shields called Cruise\\'s comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\" In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.\\nScientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment. It was reported that Cruise\\'s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise\\'s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor\\'s office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.\\nOn January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous-linked group Project Chanology, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. The Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited\", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.\\nAfter YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 15 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.\\nIn March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise\\'s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, his sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.\\nLawrence Wright\\'s 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and Alex Gibney\\'s 2015 television documentary adaptation of the same name cast a spotlight on Cruise\\'s role in Scientology. The book and the film both allege that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise\\'s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruise\\'s suggestion, which Cruise\\'s lawyer denies. Cruise\\'s ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organization\\'s auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to \"white slavery.\"\\nIn 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood\\'s most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine\\'s 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world\\'s most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn\\'t matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.\"\\nOctober 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\"\\nWhile reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise\\'s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the \"Tom Cruise Picture\". Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture: the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise\\'s later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.\\nWidescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men,[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \\'hot shot\\' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\\nCruise is an aerobatic pilot, and was inducted as part of the Living Legends of Aviation in 2010, receiving the Aviation Inspiration and Patriotism Award from the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy. In addition to other aircraft, Cruise owns a P-51 Mustang.\\nIn 1998, Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.\\nIn May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was later ordered to pay $10\\xa0million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.\\nCruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100\\xa0million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.\\nIn 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.\\nIn 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise\\'s behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir\\'s claim.\\nIn October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter. During deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without his seeing her. The suit was ultimately settled between the two parties.')"

Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990 and adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorces from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available. Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple\\'s daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization. His involvement in the organization leaked in 1990, and he publicly admitted to following Scientology in 1992 in an interview with Barbara Walters. According to the book Inside Scientology: The Story of America\\'s Most Secretive Religion by Janet Reitman, Cruise started studying Scientology for seven years. He removed himself from the Church and worked on the film Wide Wide Shut until 1999 when David Miscavige sent Marty Rathbun to successfully \"retrieve\" Cruise and convince him to continue training. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise\\'s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise.

He has campaigned for Scientology to be afforded the status of a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin. He lobbied British Prime Minister Tony Blair to recognize the Scientology organization as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization in the United Kingdom. For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004. In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement: \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" Further controversy ensued in 2005, when he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments. Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment. It was reported that Cruise\\'s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Lee Kingsley, resigned. Cruise\\'s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, herself a Scientologist. She served as Cruise\\'s publicist until 2005 when she was replaced by Paul Bloch. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes and Alex Gibney\\'s 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. The Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited\", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation. After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. As of June 2020, the video has achieved over 15 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.'}]\n",

       " 'Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. One of the world\\'s highest-paid actors, he has received various accolades, including an Honorary Palme d\\'Or and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards. His films have grossed over $4 billion in North America and over $11.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing box-office stars of all time.\\nCruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his breakthrough with leading roles in the comedy film Risky Business (1983) and action film Top Gun (1986). Critical acclaim came with his roles in the dramas The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988), and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). For his portrayal of Ron Kovic in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. As a leading Hollywood star in the 1990s, he starred in several commercially successful films, including the drama A Few Good Men (1992), the thriller The Firm (1993), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the romance Jerry Maguire (1996). For the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and received his second Academy Award nomination. Cruise\\'s performance as a motivational speaker in the drama Magnolia (1999) earned him another Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\\nSince then, Cruise has largely starred in science fiction and action films, establishing himself as an action star, often performing his own risky stunts. He has played Ethan Hunt in all six of the Mission: Impossible films from 1996 to 2018. His other notable roles in the genre include Vanilla Sky (2001), Minority Report (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), War of the Worlds (2005), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), Oblivion (2013), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and Top Gun: Maverick (2022), with Maverick being his highest-grossing film.\\nCruise has been married to actresses Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, and Katie Holmes. He has three children, two of whom were adopted during his marriage to Kidman and the other of whom is a biological daughter he had with Holmes. Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology, which he credits with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, he sparked controversy with his criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, his efforts to promote Scientology in Europe, and a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.\\nCruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films. Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\", a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. He elaborated, \"[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he\\'d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, \\'There\\'s something wrong with this guy. Don\\'t trust him. Be careful around him.\\'\"\\nIn total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years. Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that \"the movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble piece.\" In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South. Cruise\\'s biological father died of cancer in 1984. Cruise briefly took a Catholic Church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a Franciscan priest before being expelled from the seminary for drinking. This led to his becoming interested in acting.:\\u200a24–26\\u200a In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.:\\u200a47\\u200a He went on to star in the school\\'s production of Guys and Dolls. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\\nAt age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films. He first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise.\" He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985. By 1986\\'s Top Gun, his status as a superstar had been cemented.\\nCruise followed up Top Gun with Martin Scorsese\\'s The Color of Money (1986), which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. Their chemistry won praise among critics with The Washington Post writing, \"One of the subtle achievements of both Cruise\\'s and Newman\\'s performances is that you feel that both of them are genuinely top-notch pool hustlers\". In 1988, Cruise starred in Cocktail, a film that was a box office success but failed with critics. His performance earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Barry Levinson\\'s Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor.\\nIn 1989, Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone\\'s war epic Born on the Fourth of July. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Nothing Cruise has done will prepare you for what he does in Born on the Fourth of July\\xa0... His performance is so good that the movie lives through it. Stone is able to make his statement with Cruise\\'s face and voice and doesn\\'t need to put everything into the dialogue.\" The performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor –  Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise\\'s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.\\nCruise\\'s next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan\\'s Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice\\'s best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.\\nIn 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. The film was directed by Brian De Palma and was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series. Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Cruise\\'s performance, declaring \"Tom Cruise has found the perfect superhero character on which to graft his breathlessly gung-ho screen personality.\" In the same year, Cruise took on the title role in Cameron Crowe\\'s sports drama Jerry Maguire playing a sports agent in search of love. He stars opposite Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. The film was a massive financial success with Cruise earning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor.\\nIn 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in Stanley Kubrick\\'s erotic and psychological drama film Eyes Wide Shut. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised both Cruise and Kidman on their performances writing, \"Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor\". That same year he took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s Magnolia (1999). Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers heaped praise on Cruise writing, \"Cruise is a revelation, fully deserving of the shower of superlatives coming his way\\xa0... Cruise seethes with the chaotic energy of a wounded animal – he\\'s devastating.\" For his performance he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.\\nIn 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style; it continued the series\\' success at the box office, taking in $547 million worldwide. Unlike its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for the film.\\nHis next five films were major critical and commercial successes. The following year, Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report, which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.\\nIn 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick\\'s period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral. The critical consensus states that \"Driven by director Michael Mann\\'s trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.\" In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4\\xa0million worldwide. Also in 2005, he was a nominee for the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the winner of the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100\\xa0million at the box office.\\nIn 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400\\xa0million at the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as \"Les Grossman\" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008, to box office success.\\nIn March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to that date.\\nOn May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages (2012), in which he played the fictional character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012 and was a rare box-office misstep for Cruise. Cruise however received positive reviews for his performance with Variety\\'s film critic Justin Chang writing, \"Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos, heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow, Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his world\\'s-biggest-movie-star identity, displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers haven\\'t seen since his turn in Magnolia.\"\\nCruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012. It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $217 million worldwide. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski\\'s graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $286 million worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews and grossed over $370 million.\\nIn 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced. Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success. Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff\\'s 1932 horror movie The Mummy. The new film, also titled The Mummy received negative reviews and flopped at the box office. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed over $791 million at the box office. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to date.\\nIn May 2020, it was reported that Cruise would be starring in and producing a movie shot in outer space. Doug Liman would be directing, writing, and co-producing. Both will fly to the International Space Station as part of a future Axiom Space mission in a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft.\\nIn May 2021, Cruise protested against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by returning all three of his Golden Globe Awards in light of controversy surrounding the HFPA, particularly its lack of diversity, specifically no black members, and ethical questions related to financial benefits to some of its members.\\nIn 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in Top Gun: Maverick, a film which he also executive produced. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Cruise earned an Honorary Palme d\\'Or. The film was released to widespread critical praise, with many reviewers deeming it superior to its predecessor. The film broke several box office records upon its release; earning over $1 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of his career. Cruise earned $100 million for the film, when combining ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenues.\\nCruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise\\'s films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise\\'s first project as a producer.\\nCruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise\\'s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise\\'s exceptional commercial prowess.\\nCruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise\\'s film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson\\'s New York Times bestseller The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago\\'s World\\'s Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World\\'s Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.\\nCruise has produced several films in which he appeared. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.\\nOn August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In The Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount\\'s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise\\'s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount\\'s announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.\\nIndustry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount\\'s discontent over Cruise/Wagner\\'s exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.\\nIn November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists. Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA\\'s chief executive.\\nProduction began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,[citation needed] opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.\\nIn August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise\\'s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.\\nCruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Clearwater, Florida; and the South of England where Cruise has lived in various places including Central London, Dulwich, East Grinstead, and Biggin Hill.\\nIn the early-to-mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with Melissa Gilbert, Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher.\\nCruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987. They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers had grown up in Scientology and was one of its \\'auditors\\'; they met when Cruise became one of her clients. After she left the organization, she blamed its leader, David Miscavige, for the break-up of their marriage.\\nCruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy seemingly ended in a miscarriage, but in 2007, Kidman clarified the rumors by explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.\\nCruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). Their three-year relationship ended in 2004. An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of \"auditions\" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with Iranian-British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology. Scientology and Cruise\\'s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\". Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.\\nIn April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed TomKat by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show; he jumped on Winfrey\\'s yellow couch and stood there. Media coverage at the time implied that Oprah was somewhat taken aback by Cruise\\'s outburst, which distracted from the intended promotion of Cruise\\'s current film, War of the Worlds.[citation needed] On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child. In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born. On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. Their publicists said the couple had \"officialized\" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise\\'s best man. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available. Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple\\'s daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization.\\nCruise was converted to Scientology by his first wife Mimi Rogers in 1986, becoming an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology in the 2000s. His involvement in the organization was leaked by the tabloid Star in 1990, and he publicly admitted to following Scientology in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters. According to the book Inside Scientology: The Story of America\\'s Most Secretive Religion by Janet Reitman, seven years after Cruise started studying Scientology, the organization\\'s leaders promised to share Scientology secrets, such as the prophet Xenu. According to Reitman\\'s book, Cruise \"freaked out\" and took a step back. He removed himself from the Church and worked on the film Eyes Wide Shut until 1999 when David Miscavige sent Marty Rathbun to successfully \"retrieve\" Cruise and convince him to continue training. Cruise had become a full-on zealot after a couple of years. Cruise is friends with the Scientology organization\\'s chairman David Miscavige. Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.\\nIn addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be afforded the status of a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin. They described him as a militant spokesman for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him. He lobbied British Prime Minister Tony Blair to recognize the Scientology organization as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] In the United States, he convinced Bush administration officials Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Scooter Libby to oppose the non-recognition of Scientology in Germany in 2003.[citation needed] In 2004, he met Secretary of Education Rod Paige about endorsing Scientologist education methods as part of No Child Left Behind.[citation needed]\\nCruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from medical professionals and firefighters. For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004. Former Scientologist Paul Haggis also claimed that Cruise attempted to convert celebrities such as James Packer, Victoria and David Beckham, Jada Pinkett and Will Smith, and Steven Spielberg to Scientology.\\nIn January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement: \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" Further controversy ensued in 2005, when he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.\" This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBC\\'s Today on June 24, 2005.\\nMedical authorities view Cruise\\'s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. From The Lancet, \"He may be right that psychotropic drugs are overused, sometimes misused; and that lifestyle changes (and exercise for depression) can be helpful. But he is wrong, as a celebrity, to add to the burden of those with a mental illness, who often fear seeking or continuing treatment because of the stigma still attached to their condition.\" Shields called Cruise\\'s comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\" In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.\\nScientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment. It was reported that Cruise\\'s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise\\'s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor\\'s office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.\\nOn January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous-linked group Project Chanology, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. The Church of Scientology said the video had been \"pirated and edited\", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.\\nAfter YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 15 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.\\nIn March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise\\'s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, his sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.\\nLawrence Wright\\'s 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and Alex Gibney\\'s 2015 television documentary adaptation of the same name cast a spotlight on Cruise\\'s role in Scientology. The book and the film both allege that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise\\'s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruise\\'s suggestion, which Cruise\\'s lawyer denies. Cruise\\'s ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organization\\'s auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to \"white slavery.\"\\nIn 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood\\'s most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine\\'s 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world\\'s most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn\\'t matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.\"\\nOctober 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\"\\nWhile reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise\\'s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the \"Tom Cruise Picture\". Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture: the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise\\'s later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.\\nWidescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men,[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \\'hot shot\\' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\\nCruise is an aerobatic pilot, and was inducted as part of the Living Legends of Aviation in 2010, receiving the Aviation Inspiration and Patriotism Award from the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy. In addition to other aircraft, Cruise owns a P-51 Mustang.\\nIn 1998, Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.\\nIn May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was later ordered to pay $10\\xa0million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.\\nCruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100\\xa0million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.\\nIn 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.\\nIn 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise\\'s behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir\\'s claim.\\nIn October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter. During deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without his seeing her. The suit was ultimately settled between the two parties.')"

       "'Cruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his breakthrough with leading roles in the comedy film Risky Business (1983) and action film Top Gun (1986). Cruise\\'s performance as a motivational speaker in the drama Magnolia (1999) earned him another Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Since then, Cruise has largely starred in science fiction and action films, establishing himself as an action star, often performing his own risky stunts. His other notable roles in the genre include Vanilla Sky (2001), Minority Report (2002), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), War of the Worlds (2005), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), Oblivion (2013), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and Top Gun: Maverick (2022), with Maverick being his highest-grossing film. Cruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). He later described his father as \"a merchant of chaos\", a \"bully\", and a \"coward\" who beat his children. In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years. In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. Cruise\\'s biological father died of cancer in 1984. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as \"A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise.\" Cruise followed up Top Gun with Martin Scorsese\\'s The Color of Money (1986), which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. Their chemistry won praise among critics with The Washington Post writing, \"One of the subtle achievements of both Cruise\\'s and Newman\\'s performances is that you feel that both of them are genuinely top-notch pool hustlers\". In 1988, Cruise starred in Cocktail, a film that was a box office success but failed with critics. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Barry Levinson\\'s Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 1989, Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone\\'s war epic Born on the Fourth of July. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"Nothing Cruise has done will prepare you for what he does in Born on the Fourth of July\\xa0... His performance is so good that the movie lives through it. Stone is able to make his statement with Cruise\\'s face and voice and doesn\\'t need to put everything into the dialogue.\" The performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor –  Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise\\'s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination. Cruise\\'s next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller The Firm, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan\\'s Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice\\'s best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised Cruise\\'s performance, declaring \"Tom Cruise has found the perfect superhero character on which to graft his breathlessly gung-ho screen personality.\" In the same year, Cruise took on the title role in Cameron Crowe\\'s sports drama Jerry Maguire playing a sports agent in search of love. The film was a massive financial success with Cruise earning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in Stanley Kubrick\\'s erotic and psychological drama film Eyes Wide Shut. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised both Cruise and Kidman on their performances writing, \"Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor\". Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers heaped praise on Cruise writing, \"Cruise is a revelation, fully deserving of the shower of superlatives coming his way\\xa0... Cruise seethes with the chaotic energy of a wounded animal – he\\'s devastating.\" In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, Mission: Impossible 2. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for the film. The following year, Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film Minority Report, which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick. In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick\\'s period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral. The critical consensus states that \"Driven by director Michael Mann\\'s trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, Collateral is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.\" In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4\\xa0million worldwide. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008, to box office success. In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to that date. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages (2012), in which he played the fictional character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012 and was a rare box-office misstep for Cruise. Cruise however received positive reviews for his performance with Variety\\'s film critic Justin Chang writing, \"Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos, heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow, Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his world\\'s-biggest-movie-star identity, displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers haven\\'t seen since his turn in Magnolia.\" Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child\\'s 2005 novel One Shot. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski\\'s graphic novel of the same name. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film Edge of Tomorrow, which received positive reviews and grossed over $370 million. In 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced. Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff\\'s 1932 horror movie The Mummy. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise\\'s biggest commercial success to date. In May 2020, it was reported that Cruise would be starring in and producing a movie shot in outer space. In May 2021, Cruise protested against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by returning all three of his Golden Globe Awards in light of controversy surrounding the HFPA, particularly its lack of diversity, specifically no black members, and ethical questions related to financial benefits to some of its members. In 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in Top Gun: Maverick, a film which he also executive produced. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Cruise earned an Honorary Palme d\\'Or. Cruise earned $100 million for the film, when combining ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenues. Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise\\'s films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise\\'s first project as a producer. Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as \"one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.\" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise\\'s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise\\'s exceptional commercial prowess. Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise\\'s film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson\\'s New York Times bestseller The Devil in the White City about a real-life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago\\'s World\\'s Columbian Exposition. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World\\'s Fair, in which DiCaprio will star. In The Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount\\'s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise\\'s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists. Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA\\'s chief executive. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise\\'s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio. Cruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Clearwater, Florida; and the South of England where Cruise has lived in various places including Central London, Dulwich, East Grinstead, and Biggin Hill. In the early-to-mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with Melissa Gilbert, Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher. Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. Scientology and Cruise\\'s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of \"shoddy journalism\" and \"religious bigotry\". In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show; he jumped on Winfrey\\'s yellow couch and stood there. Media coverage at the time implied that Oprah was somewhat taken aback by Cruise\\'s outburst, which distracted from the intended promotion of Cruise\\'s current film, War of the Worlds. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise\\'s best man. Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple\\'s daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization. Cruise was converted to Scientology by his first wife Mimi Rogers in 1986, becoming an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology in the 2000s. According to the book Inside Scientology: The Story of America\\'s Most Secretive Religion by Janet Reitman, seven years after Cruise started studying Scientology, the organization\\'s leaders promised to share Scientology secrets, such as the prophet Xenu. According to Reitman\\'s book, Cruise \"freaked out\" and took a step back. He removed himself from the Church and worked on the film Eyes Wide Shut until 1999 when David Miscavige sent Marty Rathbun to successfully \"retrieve\" Cruise and convince him to continue training. Cruise is friends with the Scientology organization\\'s chairman David Miscavige. Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia. In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be afforded the status of a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin. For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004. Former Scientologist Paul Haggis also claimed that Cruise attempted to convert celebrities such as James Packer, Victoria and David Beckham, Jada Pinkett and Will Smith, and Steven Spielberg to Scientology. In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement: \"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\" In response, Shields argued that Cruise \"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.\" This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBC\\'s Today on June 24, 2005. Medical authorities view Cruise\\'s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. Shields called Cruise\\'s comments \"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\" In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments. It was reported that Cruise\\'s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise\\'s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous-linked group Project Chanology, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. Cruise\\'s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, his sister, who was herself a Scientologist. Lawrence Wright\\'s 2013 book Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and Alex Gibney\\'s 2015 television documentary adaptation of the same name cast a spotlight on Cruise\\'s role in Scientology. The book and the film both allege that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise\\'s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruise\\'s suggestion, which Cruise\\'s lawyer denies. Cruise\\'s ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organization\\'s auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to \"white slavery.\" In 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood\\'s most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine\\'s 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the \"two stars, it doesn\\'t matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.\" October 10, 2006, was declared \"Tom Cruise Day\" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of \"his love for and close association with Japan.\" While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise\\'s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the \"Tom Cruise Picture\". Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture: the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise\\'s later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula. Widescreenings compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film A Few Good Men,[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \\'hot shot\\' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. In 1998, Cruise successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality. In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was later ordered to pay $10\\xa0million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis for $100\\xa0million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual. In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006. In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise\\'s behest. In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had \"abandoned\" his six-year-old daughter.'"
